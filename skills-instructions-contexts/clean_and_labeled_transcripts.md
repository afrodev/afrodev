### [1: Actual first entry - voice ideation]

**[Vibe: Cultural Dissonance & Masking]**
This one is really important. I want to say that the stupidity they saw in me, the disrespect they gave me, and the lack of empathy to understand what really was going on was a mental confusion of cultures I was a part of that communicated very differently. Even though I spoke the language perfectly—you could have never guessed from hearing me on the phone, for example—that led me to a path of being assumed to be one of them. It was a path of inclusion, which is nice, but it masked the lack of cultural exposure I got from that small town I lived in of 6,000 people. It masked it with the language. People came in assuming I was 100% on board with everything, their social cues and their cultural norms, even the minutia of it, and they were let down constantly by my lack of understanding of what they want from me or what they need. I understand from their perspective I just seemed ignorant, but that still had its effect on me. It had the effect that I was looked at as, "Oh, we thought he was one of us, and he is, but he's just very stupid. He's going to ask stupid and silly questions, so just ignore him. Just answer them silly back, he's just vibing."

**[Vibe: Revelation & Belonging]**
But in Berkeley, when I finally got to speak English, it all switched up. It changed since I was able to speak that language. With that, I finally got to see the trial version of how I would look if I had grown up in a supportive environment that was empathetic to understanding people's multicultural backgrounds. Sure, it might not have been Berkeley specifically; it could have been anywhere in the world that is a global hub for people where English is the main language and they have Western culture.

**[Vibe: The "Africa Problem" & Identity]**
It's crazy because this whole thing started with me saying I might sound like I'm really good at the language, and that ends up coming with the assumption I'm probably good at the culture too. Being isolated or looked down on is insane. I express myself in English using my experience with Black American English because it has been close to home. I am sick of being villainized because I say that when I'm hanging with educated Norwegians. There are not many like me—educated immigrants from Africa in higher education here in Norway.

**[Vibe: Misunderstood & Authentic Voice]**
I say it in a way that sounds self-centered, but I don't mean it like that. I'm actually struggling with the problem, but the only way I know how to explain it is through the language of someone who did it "wrong," because no one else dares. I've been misunderstood for so long that I'm now used to it. No one dares to go into a relationship with another human in Norway deeply enough to have ever heard me say that in Norwegian. They get uncomfortable and they pull away. But in the US, in Canada, in Sudan, in Egypt, in Turkey and Portugal, they did. That's how I have kept up a strong relationship with these people throughout the years. I have seen how they've grown up, I've met their friends, they've come to my country, and I've gone to theirs. Each one of those people left an imprint on me. That can go for the Statement of Purpose.

**[Action: Content & Output Strategy]**
The main goal now is to reduce the "Africa problem definition" a little bit and fit more emotional reasoning within the text. I have way more than I need of the Sudan problem definition compared to the emotional part, which was the fun part. I need to mention Bobby Dunphy, the investor lady, and Judy Ling from UC Berkeley Corporate Law; those interactions meant a lot to me. All these people from such different backgrounds and mixes of shades who, in Norway, would have stayed working a low-tier job because of the disparity in job opportunities. They gave me hope for the future of diverse people and the impact they can have on their countries.

**[Action: Multi-platform Formatting]**
I want to express that in the main text in a cohesive way that fits into the letter to Silicon Valley, UC Berkeley, and Phi Kappa Tau. Keep it concise for 1,000 words for the Personal History Statement and 1,000 words for the Statement of Purpose. For the full letter on my website, afrodev.dev, I'll put everything in. For LinkedIn, I'll tag everyone at the bottom and list the experiences I had with them and the impact it had on me. We can make it a three-chapter short version: Number one is Silicon Valley, then UC Berkeley, and lastly the Phi Kappa Tau experience. On LinkedIn, maybe start with the Phi Kappa Tau chapter. Each section should be 5 to 10 lines—long enough to hype someone up to read the full version.

**[Vibe: Visual Brand Identity]**
The graphic version of the article is going to be text with a contrasting, monochromatic background—something like deep fuchsia or crimson with light pink text. The article is going to be padded inside the frame with photos of my experiences in the corners for realism. This is for LinkedIn and Instagram. This is my new personality. I'm just going to post it everywhere. This is a fun project, a big all-in winner. I'll build the repository for the website in real time and use AI agents to automate the cleaning up of the text so I can pick the most cohesive versions. This workflow allows me to be more patient with writing and accelerated learning.

**[Action: Technical Processing]**
AI, you have to label the sections in brackets with a keyword, emotion, or vibe. Label the beginning and end of those sections so I can use that data to construct the story. I don't want you to make creative or editorial suggestions to my actual story; I just want to say it in better words in one go. I'm doing this so I can get the thoughts out. If you put them out there, you see which ones are smart or fun, and you take that information to become a better version of yourself. It's been a crazy Christmas break.

**[Vibe: Cultural Dissonance & Social Barriers]**
Man, it's crazy. This whole thing started with me saying I might sound like I'm really good at the language, and that ends up coming with the assumption that I'm probably good at the culture too. Being isolated or looked down on because of that is insane. I express myself in English using Black American English because my experience with them has been close to home.

**[Vibe: Relational Depth & International Imprint]**
I've been misunderstood for so long that I'm now used to it. No one dares to go into a relationship with another human in Norway deeply enough to have ever heard me say that in Norwegian. They get uncomfortable and pull away. But in the US, Canada, Sudan, Egypt, Turkey, and Portugal, they did. That's how I have kept up strong relationships throughout the years.

The main goal now is to reduce the "Africa problem definition" a little bit and fit more emotional reasoning within the text.

Keep it concise for 1,000 words for the Personal History Statement and the Statement of Purpose. For the actual full letter on the website, I’m going to put everything in, nothing taken out. On LinkedIn, I’ll make a three-chapter short version: number one is Silicon Valley, then UC Berkeley, and lastly the Phi Kappa Tau experience. Each chapter should be 5 to 10 lines long—catchy enough to hype people up to read the full version. I’ll tag everyone involved at the bottom of the post.

**[Vibe: Visual Identity & Design]**
The graphic version of the article is going to be text with a contrasting, monochromatic color scheme—deep fuchsia or crimson background with light pink text. It’s going to be padded heavily with photos of my experiences in the corners for realism. This is a fun project, a big all-in winner. I’m going to start the repository to build the website in real time and use AI agents to automate the cleaning of the text so I can pick the most cohesive versions. This workflow allows me to be more patient with writing and see what correct versions of what I want to say look like.

**[Vibe: Self-Reflection & Creative Process]**
I’m posting these recordings and transcripts on the website so people can hear how I ideate. I want to keep my original voice—direct and friend-to-friend. This is how I share myself with the world. I don’t want the AI to make editorial suggestions to my actual story; I just want to say it in better words. I need to label sections in brackets with keywords or emotions to construct the cohesive story. It's better than talking to the AI live mode that keeps interrupting you. This hour-long recording allowed me to let it all out so I can see which thoughts are smart, fun, or kind, and become a better version of myself.

**[Vibe: High Energy & Ideation]**
Holy shit, there’s so much I gotta say and I gotta say it fast. This recording is a good way of showing you how I work, think, and ideate. I haven't found people who understand it other than when I was at UC Berkeley and Phi Kappa Tau. Yes, I've had an insane experience, and that's why this is the long version.

**[Action: PHS Disclaimer & Hook]**
The Personal History Statement version for the Berkeley application should start with a disclaimer. I know the statement is not supposed to repeat my resume or focus directly on stats. Instead, I’ve chosen to focus on the growth I had from my experience at Berkeley and how it contrasts with the challenges I faced growing up. In just three months, it changed the mental and emotional damage I had incurred from childhood. Berkeley was a combination of everything I am. After that, the hook: "People ask me all the time how my time at Berkeley was, and I usually reply with: It was an insane experience." But that’s just the short version; the long version involves the people I met and the experiences I had.

**[Action: Technical Workflow & Data Management]**
I need a markdown version of the clean transcripts with labeling in brackets for theme, topic, or vibe. This allows my eyes to quickly scan and query the collection for sentences with certain labels. I can automate this workflow to ideate anytime I want. Even though the deadline is in two days, I am pulling an all-nighter. This is me at my most creative, when I get to think out loud.

**[Vibe: Accelerated Learning & Resilience]**
Despite the timelines being short, doing is never my challenge. The isolation I experienced led me to dive into computers, learn technology, and build systems. It’s always been a blessing in disguise. My ADHD means I start a thought and can't speak it fast enough, but I use that energy to learn a bunch of stuff and gamify tasks. I don’t follow the textbook of doing things task-by-task because that assumes you aren’t expanding. I love to continuously learn and move to the next thing.

**[Vibe: Personal Context & Sudan Roots]**
I’ve had four surgeries in my knee; I’m best friends with every doctor in the region. I’m the first in my family to get an education at this level in a country other than Sudan. It means a lot to get this far despite the challenges. I solve problems to get back to zero, but then I work to get to where I actually want to be. I’m walking in a figure-eight pattern right now because I need the physical movement to stay cohesive. I’ve trained myself to love not procrastinating because the benefits far outweigh the cons.

**[Action: Project Transparency]**
You can be a part of this entire process of writing this UC Berkeley application and LinkedIn posts by following it live on my website. You can look at the timestamps on GitHub, the recordings, and the screenshots. Have fun with it.

### [6: E5 cue multidisciplinary all-nighter]

**[Action: The All-Nighter]**
Cue the all-nighter of media editing, software engineering, agent orchestration, data collection, and writing. I’m going to crash hard at the end of this, but I gotta catch up.

### [7: E6 title of bts version of text - making of]

**[Action: Content Differentiation]**
Bear in mind we need multiple versions of the text. One version is "The Making Of": how I made this essay and applied to UC Berkeley while building an AI agent orchestration software for subsidy farm data in less than two days.

### [8: E7 Subhanallah the food just appeared]

**[Vibe: Serendipity & Gratitude]**
Look at how serendipitous the universe is. As I finished recording and decided I needed a break to eat, Safayet—who will be my first employee—called me and offered me free burgers right by my house. I thank God for this insane luck. I do not take it for granted and I recognize the unfair advantage it grants me.

### [9: E8 Extra addition to SOP]

**[Vibe: Silicon Valley & Market Analysis]**
I’ve wanted to go to Silicon Valley since I was 13, and I made it by 23. During my time at Berkeley researching businesses and startups, I observed patterns in how certain markets are dominated by monopolies or duopolies. How you incentivize businesses to run has a huge social impact. Engineering solutions that sound fine on paper can create huge unintentional negative consequences.

**[Vibe: Social Engineering & Berkeley’s Identity]**
Whether you want it or not, your activity has a social consequence. If you build a tram system like the one in Oslo but force everyone with strollers into a segregated entrance at the back, you are segmenting people. Parents end up only talking to parents, and you change the development of a demographic. As an engineer, I want to study somewhere that makes it their identity to solve that—and what better place for that than Berkeley? This belongs in the Statement of Purpose.
