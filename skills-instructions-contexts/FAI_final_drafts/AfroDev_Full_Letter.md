# To Phi Kappa Tau, UC Berkeley, and Silicon Valley

**An Open Letter from Monzer Faisal**

People ask me all the time how my time at Berkeley was, and I usually reply with: *"It was an insane experience."*

That’s the short version. The long version is that in three months, you undid sixteen years of damage.

I grew up as the "only one." The only Black family in a Norwegian town of 6,000. The only "class clown" who was actually just bored and misunderstood. For years, I masked my identity, learning to speak the language so perfectly that I could pass for a local on the phone, only to see the confusion on people's faces when I walked into the room. I was fighting a constant, silent war against a culture of *Janteloven* that told me to sit down, be quiet, and fit in.

But I wasn't built to fit in. I taught myself to code, dance, edit video, and build businesses while I was supposed to be doing homework. I had four surgeries on my knee and coded my bachelor's thesis from a hospital bed on morphine because I refused to let my body stop my mind. I was an engine built for high speed, stuck in a playground zone.

**Then I met you.**

In Berkeley, the suffocating weight of "being different" evaporated. For the first time, my high energy wasn't "disruptive"—it was "founder material." My background wasn't unique in a bad way; it was a competitive advantage.

I remember walking into a co-working space in Oakland, just a kid with a laptop. Two Managing Partners of a massive VC firm stopped their day just to talk to me. They didn’t check my credentials; they checked my drive. That fifteen-minute conversation did more for my soul than a decade of "integration" efforts back home.

You showed me a culture of abundance. Copious, overflowing opportunity that you didn't hoard, but shared. You taught me that if you have the keys, you don't lock the door—you open it for the next person.

**The Mission: Sudan**

Now, I’m taking that energy home. Not to Norway, but to Sudan.

Sudan is bleeding. It’s trapped in a "resource curse," where the only value the world sees comes from what we dig out of the ground—gold and oil—often at the cost of human life. Rulers don't need to care about people when their money comes from dirt.

I’m going to change that math. I am building the digital infrastructure—data centers and ISPs—that will turn the Sudanese people into the country's greatest asset. When the economy runs on human intellect and connectivity, the government is forced to invest in humans, not destroy them.

I launched **afrodev** to prove it’s possible. To prove that we can execute at Silicon Valley speeds, even when the odds are stacked against us.

**Thank You.**

To the people who saw me when I was invisible:

*   **To Bobby Dunphy & The Phi Kappa Tau Brothers:** You gave me a home, literally and metaphorically. You showed me what brotherhood actually looks like.
*   **To Judy Ling:** Your guidance in Corporate Law showed me how to protect my ideas without losing my soul.
*   **To Professor Naeem Zafar:** You taught me that power isn't a dirty word—it's a tool. You helped me pivot from just making "logical arguments" to understanding true influence.
*   **To the VCs in Oakland:** Thank you for stopping. You’ll never know how much that mattered.

Scale is not just about code. It’s about people. And because of you, I’m ready to scale.

*Let's build.*
