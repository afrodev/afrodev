**Listen, I know the personal history statement isn't just a resume summary, and I know I could humble-brag about my "accomplishments." Like moving out only to be stolen from, assaulted, and almost stabbed by Norwegian roommate whose case Oslo police dismissed despite GBs of video evidence—all while working 12 hours a day to prevent my family's homelessness. Building the business I started at 17 with the governor's permission. Or how I navigated resulting debt and collections. I could mention finishing my 3-year first-gen degree in two years despite late ADHD-I diagnosis and 4 knee surgeries. I even coded my thesis from a hospital bed during at he month of life-threatening septic arthritis on morphine. I could detail spending a 3rd year fighting systemic rigidity that dropped my ITF20319 grade from a "D" to an "E" after formal complaint. Or even attending Berkeley at 23, completing my decade-long goal of working in an SV startup — since 13. Or maybe boast about placing 2nd in my cohort presentation—losing by one point despite a halved team—while still hiking Yosemite post-surgery to prove to myself I can do anything.

I could do that... But I won't.

1. Cuz that's boring.
2. There's more to life than that.

Instead, my PHS is an open


As I walk in to the frat for the first time, I'm greeted by Peter Choi, A Korean-American who seemed like the funniest, most unserious person, only for me to discover how hard working he was at the same time. Along with Jason Lee, who graduated with honors, they had been kind enough to invite me to their CDSS Class of '25 graduation, on my 2nd day. In those 2 days I got to talk to a bunch of the frat guys an their friends. I met undeniable geniuses in all different forms. One that stood out to me was Ishita Jain. Her journey from Singapore to UCB, to a NYC job right after graduation, facing uncertainty then and now, with a spark in her eye and childlike gumption. "It's Berkeley!", she said. "Work hard, play hard." Another, Mihail. Bulgarian international student staying up all night thinking about his startup, grinding research papers, and growing everyday. The frat's president, Hamza Bashir, who is the son of Palestinian immigrants, hustled his way to the top through internships across the U.S. and Middle East to make it to Oracle as a software engineer. Stella, kindly offering me F&F discount at the jewelry store she worked at because I liked the designs. Fabio, an Italian-Korean (the amount of stars that have to align for that) a kind, gentle, nurturing soul. Amin Shah showing me the ropes as his honorary "little" for the summer. I could go on about these incredible, hard-working, kind-spirited, intelligent individuals, and their sense of inclusivity and togetherness (even after our house got broken into), for days. To me, they set the blueprint for how anyone can make it at Berkeley & in life.

### Paragraph for UCB (aka facilities, social spirit, professor Naeem,


### Paragraph for Sillicon Valley

Sillicon Valley. Oh how you’ve changed me, broadened my horizons, showed me how no dream is too big, putting your tech, brains and your money where your mouth is!

You took me in like I was one of you. Coworking with genius-out-the-box-thinker, Sneh Druv, who taught me so many alternative workflows that, for once in my life, allowed me to have extra time. Enabling me to spend it exploring Cali and building close relationships across The Bay. One time I was working alone at Oakland Stakspace, when VCs, Bobbi Dunphy and Ani Chahal stopped to talk to me for literally no other reason than curiosity, as their team reminded them of their tight schedules, just to give me valuable advice and encouragement. Bobbi mind-readingly picked advice I needed. How did she know though?! Prince Kudra Kalema, for showing me that it *IS* possible to combine business, engineering, social impact to create a better Africa. Alessandro Vecchi with the same, for Central America.



Can’t forget Yuliia. My co-founder, friend and partner-in-stupid-and-smart. Couldn’t have done it without you. And Jake Scott the 23 y/o australian building Hullbot across the world’s biggest ports.



Last but not least, my CEO Jay Ruparel, Tech Lead Khuldeep Yadav and the entire team at VoicePlug, who believed in me not in spite of my wacky career history but BECAUSE of it. Seeing my experience building Bobabike (bubble tea food truck on a bike), along with SWE as a cross-diciplinary blessing and creating a safe environment to fail and learn. They enabled me to build a platform-agnostic AI agent to automate table reservations at restaurants in 2 days and learning so much about the business along the way.

When people ask me how Berkeley was, I usually just say "insane" for short, but believe it or not, this wasn't even the half of it. If I had to put it simply: Berkeley was a combination of everything that I am. These people showed me that it did not matter who you were, how big or small your dreams are. The isolation, neglect and dismissal I experienced growing up as the only Black kid in a Norwegian town of 6,000 didn't matter. All the times I was counted out didn't matter. And for that, they'll always hold a special place in my heart.



**Personal History Statement**

People often ask me how my time at Berkeley was, and I usually reply with: "It was an insane experience."

That is the short version. The long version is a story about how a single summer in California undid sixteen years of cultural dissonance and revealed to me who I could be if I weren't constantly fighting to be understood.

My family immigrated from Sudan to Norway when I was nine. We were placed in a small town of 6,000 people where we were the only Black family. In that environment, my survival mechanism was "masking." I learned to speak Norwegian perfectly—so perfectly that on the phone, you would assume I was a local. But this linguistic fluency created a trap. Because I sounded like "one of them," everyone assumed I understood the unspoken social cues, the cultural rigidities, and the law of *Janteloven*—the Scandinavian code that discouraged standing out.

I didn't. I was energetic, ambitious, and curious in a culture that valued conformity. Teachers interpreted my divergent thinking not as engagement, but as disruption. I was labeled the "class clown," a role that masked a deep confusion. I couldn't understand why my questions were dismissed as "silly" or why my high energy was met with hostility. I internalized their confusion as my own stupidity.

To survive the isolation, I built a parallel life online. While I was disregarded in the classroom, I spent twelve hours a day on my computer, teaching myself video editing, marketing, and dance. By sixteen, I was a hired hip-hop dance instructor; by nineteen, my ventures were paying my family's rent. Yet, in the eyes of my Norwegian educators and peers, I remained the "outsider" who just didn't get it. I was constantly battling a system that saw my background as a deficit rather than a perspective.

Then came Berkeley.

I arrived in the Bay Area for the Gründerskolen program, carrying the weight of that imposter syndrome. I expected another battle. Instead, I found a culture of abundance that felt like oxygen after years of holding my breath.

At Berkeley, and in the wider Silicon Valley ecosystem, my "deficits" were suddenly assets. My high energy wasn't "disruptive"; it was "founder energy." My non-traditional background wasn't "confusing"; it was "unique perspective."

I remember walking into a co-working space in Oakland. I was just a student working alone, but two Managing Partners of a VC firm with a $49B+ portfolio stopped their entire team just to introduce themselves. They didn't care about my pedigree or that I didn't fit the mold; they saw someone working hard and offered me networking tips and their personal contacts. In fifteen minutes, they validated what I had been questioning about myself for over a decade.

For the first time, I wasn't the "class clown" masking his intellect. I was Monzer, the engineer and entrepreneur, and that was enough. I met people who looked like me, spoke like me—mixing sophisticated technical English with the cadence of Black American culture—and who were leading global companies. I met a Ugandan entrepreneur building renewable energy grids; I met Corporate Law experts like Judy Ling and investors like Bobby Dunphy who didn't just tolerate my ambition—they fueled it.

This wasn't just professional networking; it was profound emotional healing. I saw a "trial version" of who I could be in a supportive environment. The cultural dissonance that had plagued me in Norway vanished. I realized that the friction I felt wasn't because I was "broken" or "stupid," but because I was an engine built for high velocity stuck in a school zone.

I am applying to the Master of Engineering program not just for the technical skills, but because Berkeley is the only place where I have been able to be my full self. I want to return to the environment that turned my "insane experience" into a clear vision. I want to formalize the leadership style I discovered there—one that leverages diversity not as a quota, but as a competitive advantage. I am ready to stop surviving my environment and start engineering it, bringing the velocity of Berkeley back to the problems that need it most.
