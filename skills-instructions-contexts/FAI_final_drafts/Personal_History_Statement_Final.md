Listen, I know the personal history statement isn't just a resume summary, and I know I could humble-brag about my "accomplishments." Like moving out only to be stolen from, assaulted, and almost stabbed by Norwegian roommate whose case Oslo police dismissed despite GBs of video evidence—all while working 12 hours a day to prevent my family's homelessness. Building the business I started at 17 with the governor's permission. Or how I navigated resulting debt and collections. I could mention finishing my 3-year first-gen degree in two years despite late ADHD-I diagnosis and 4 knee surgeries. I even coded my thesis from a hospital bed during the month of life-threatening septic arthritis on morphine. I could detail spending a 3rd year fighting systemic rigidity that dropped my ITF20319 grade from a "D" to an "E" after formal complaint. Or even attending Berkeley at 23, completing my decade-long goal of working in an SV startup — since 13. Or maybe boast about placing 2nd in my cohort presentation—losing by one point despite a halved team—while still hiking Yosemite post-surgery to prove to myself I can do anything.

I could do that... But I won't.

1. Cuz that's boring.
2. There's more to life than that.

Instead, my PHS is an open


## Letter to Phi Kappa Tau, UC Berkeley & Silicon Valley

As I walk in to the frat, I'm greeted by Peter Choi, who seemed like the funniest, most unserious person, only for me to discover how hard-working he was. Along with Jason, they invited me to their CDSS graduation on my 2nd day. In those 2 days I met their circle of undeniable-geniuses from all walks. One was Ishita Jain. Her journey from Singapore to UCB, to a NYC job, facing uncertainty with a spark in her eye and a childlike gumption. "It's Berkeley!", she said. "Work hard, play hard." Another, Mihail, a Bulgarian international student staying up all night grinding research papers for his startup. PKT's president, Hamza Bashir, the son of Palestinian immigrants, hustling his way to the top through internships to make it to Oracle. Stella, kindly offering me F&F discount at the jewelry store she worked at because I liked the designs. Fabio, an Italian-Korean (the amount of stars that have to align for that combo) a kind, gentle, nurturing soul. Amin Shah showing me the ropes as his honorary "little" for the summer. I could go on about these incredible, hard-working, kind-spirited, intelligent individuals, and their sense of inclusivity and togetherness (even after our house got broken into), for days. To me, they set the blueprint for how anyone can make it at Berkeley & in life.




The Berkeley community's generosity extended far beyond what I expected. Gifted with a supportive multicultural environment, and an alumni that goes above and beyond to pay it forward. I scheduled a 15-minute coffee chat with Judy Deng, a UC Law alum, she stayed for an hour, putting me on game about navigating tech and law. Special thanks to Komal Ahmad (ex-Military, female social entrepreneur) who showed me that a business can do good sustainably without being a charity. Not to mention the amount of new AI and tech research from here is just mind boggling.

Above all else, my time with Professor Naeem Zafar defies description. This man came from Pakistan in the 80s during his 20’s with $300 in his pocket and a chip on his shoulder just to end up with 7 successful exits and IPOs. WHO ELSE!?! His guidance and teachings were personal, tailored to your needs, refreshingly, yet brutally honest. And despite my being “a bad student” (his words), to this day, he never declines a call. Naeem pushed me to become a better version of myself.




Silicon Valley. Oh how you’ve changed me, broadened my horizons, showed me how no dream is too big, putting your tech, brains and your money where your mouth is! You took me in like I was one of you. Coworking with genius-out-the-box-thinker, Sneh Druv, who taught me so many alternative workflows that, for once in my life, allowed me to have extra time. Enabling me to spend it exploring Cali and building close relationships across The Bay. One time I was working alone at Oakland Stakspace, when VCs, Bobbi Dunphy and Ani Chahal stopped to talk to me for literally no other reason than curiosity, as their team reminded them of their tight schedules, just to give me valuable advice and encouragement. Bobbi mind-readingly picked advice I needed. How did she know though?! Prince Kudra Kalema, for showing me that it IS possible to combine business, engineering, social impact to create a better Africa. Alessandro Vecchi with the same, for Central America.

Can’t forget Yuliia. My co-founder, friend and partner-in-stupid-and-smart. Couldn’t have done it without you. And Jake Scott the 23 y/o Australian building Hullbot across the world’s biggest ports.

Last but not least, my CEO Jay Ruparel, Tech Lead Khuldeep Yadav and the entire team at VoicePlug, who believed in me not in spite of my wacky career history but BECAUSE of it. Viewing my Bobabike experience, along with SWE as a cross-disciplinary blessing and creating a safe environment to fail and learn. They enabled me to build a platform-agnostic AI agent to automate table reservations at restaurants in 2 days and learning so much about the business along the way.

When people ask me how Berkeley was, I usually just say "insane" for short, but believe it or not, this wasn't even the half of it. If I had to put it simply: Berkeley was a combination of everything that I am. These people showed me that it did not matter who you were, how big or small your dreams are. The isolation I met as I grew up the only black kid in a Norwegian town of 6000 people, did not matter. All the times I was counted out, did not matter. And for that, they have a special place in my heart.
