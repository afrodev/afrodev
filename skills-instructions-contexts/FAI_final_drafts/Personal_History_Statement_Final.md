**Disclaimer:**
Listen, I know that the personal history statement is not supposed to be a summary of your resume. And I know that I could (and maybe should) still find one way or another to insert in all of my "accomplishments" in a seamlsess, humble-braggy way. Like how after I moved out of my parent's home, I ended up stolen from, assaulted, and almost stabbe by a 40-year-old Norwegian man who police dissmissed my case against despite GBs of video evidence I while working 12 hours/day to pay for my family's rent and my own. And how after that, as I started college, a wave bills in collection piling in the mail put me in debt and a bad credit score despite having kept that up since learning about it at 17, when I started my business after gaining special permission from the governor for minors. The same business in fact, that ended up supporting both me and my family. To then going to college as a first-gen and (despite all odds) completing my 3-year bachelor's in 2 years, getting clinically diagnosed with ADHD-I with high intelligence (specifically in VCI) according to WAIS testing while battling 4 knee surgeries throughout college and writing and coding bachelor's thesis from hospital bed as I laid there for a month of life threatning infection due to septic arthritis (0.5% chance btw) from initial surgery, with a 300 crp and "hella" morphine. Then spending the now "extra" 3rd-year fixing my grades and battling systemic rigidity that gave me a "D" on Software Engineering and Testing ITF20319 that was further pulled down to an "E" upon filing a formal, well argued complaint. Just so I could go to Berkeley and accomplish the 10-year dream of working in Silicon Valley startup that I've had since I was 13, JUST by the time I was 23. To then end up at 2nd place in cohort presenting the startup me, and my partner built. Only 1-point shy from 1st, according to Professor Naeem Zafar, DESPITE losing half the team (Cofounder mismatch), being up against teams of 5. All of that while exploring California, hiking Yosemite, even after the surgeries, proving to myself that I can do anything I put my mind to.


I *could* do that. But I won't.

1. That's stupid.. and boring..
2. There's more to life than that.


In stead, I'm letting my PHS be an open letter to Phi Kappa Tau, UCB & Sillicon Valley. People always

**Personal History Statement**

People often ask me how my time at Berkeley was, and I usually reply with: "It was an insane experience."

That is the short version. The long version is a story about how a single summer in California undid sixteen years of cultural dissonance and revealed to me who I could be if I weren't constantly fighting to be understood.

My family immigrated from Sudan to Norway when I was nine. We were placed in a small town of 6,000 people where we were the only Black family. In that environment, my survival mechanism was "masking." I learned to speak Norwegian perfectly—so perfectly that on the phone, you would assume I was a local. But this linguistic fluency created a trap. Because I sounded like "one of them," everyone assumed I understood the unspoken social cues, the cultural rigidities, and the law of *Janteloven*—the Scandinavian code that discouraged standing out.

I didn't. I was energetic, ambitious, and curious in a culture that valued conformity. Teachers interpreted my divergent thinking not as engagement, but as disruption. I was labeled the "class clown," a role that masked a deep confusion. I couldn't understand why my questions were dismissed as "silly" or why my high energy was met with hostility. I internalized their confusion as my own stupidity.

To survive the isolation, I built a parallel life online. While I was disregarded in the classroom, I spent twelve hours a day on my computer, teaching myself video editing, marketing, and dance. By sixteen, I was a hired hip-hop dance instructor; by nineteen, my ventures were paying my family's rent. Yet, in the eyes of my Norwegian educators and peers, I remained the "outsider" who just didn't get it. I was constantly battling a system that saw my background as a deficit rather than a perspective.

Then came Berkeley.

I arrived in the Bay Area for the Gründerskolen program, carrying the weight of that imposter syndrome. I expected another battle. Instead, I found a culture of abundance that felt like oxygen after years of holding my breath.

At Berkeley, and in the wider Silicon Valley ecosystem, my "deficits" were suddenly assets. My high energy wasn't "disruptive"; it was "founder energy." My non-traditional background wasn't "confusing"; it was "unique perspective."

I remember walking into a co-working space in Oakland. I was just a student working alone, but two Managing Partners of a VC firm with a $49B+ portfolio stopped their entire team just to introduce themselves. They didn't care about my pedigree or that I didn't fit the mold; they saw someone working hard and offered me networking tips and their personal contacts. In fifteen minutes, they validated what I had been questioning about myself for over a decade.

For the first time, I wasn't the "class clown" masking his intellect. I was Monzer, the engineer and entrepreneur, and that was enough. I met people who looked like me, spoke like me—mixing sophisticated technical English with the cadence of Black American culture—and who were leading global companies. I met a Ugandan entrepreneur building renewable energy grids; I met Corporate Law experts like Judy Ling and investors like Bobby Dunphy who didn't just tolerate my ambition—they fueled it.

This wasn't just professional networking; it was profound emotional healing. I saw a "trial version" of who I could be in a supportive environment. The cultural dissonance that had plagued me in Norway vanished. I realized that the friction I felt wasn't because I was "broken" or "stupid," but because I was an engine built for high velocity stuck in a school zone.

I am applying to the Master of Engineering program not just for the technical skills, but because Berkeley is the only place where I have been able to be my full self. I want to return to the environment that turned my "insane experience" into a clear vision. I want to formalize the leadership style I discovered there—one that leverages diversity not as a quota, but as a competitive advantage. I am ready to stop surviving my environment and start engineering it, bringing the velocity of Berkeley back to the problems that need it most.
