## Hi there 👋

My name is Monzer Faisal. I don’t know how to sit still. I build things, solve problems, go on adventures. Both behind the screen and IRL. Most importantly, I enjoy every part of it🎉

🤓 Here you can see my favorite software projects that I have built or been a part of.

⚠️ Careful where you walk! Some of them are under construction… for the past 2 years👀
